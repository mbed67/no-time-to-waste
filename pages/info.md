We are living in a busy world. We have to go to work, take care of the kids, study ...
And yes we care about the earth and the environment, and we would also like to be more zen, but we don't have time.

A sustainable and mindful lifestyle doesn't have to take much time and effort though. Maybe we have to form a few new habits.
But you can take baby steps. This blog intends to help you integrate sustainable and mindful behaviour into your busy schedule.

Enjoy!
