Your daily commute is a great opportunity to practise mindfulness. Let's explore several ways we can be mindful.

### Setting your intention
Being mindful will be much easier if you explicitly set your intention to be mindful. You can say to yourself: 
"Today I will focus on the here and the now while travelling to work".

### Walking
When walking to the bus, or to the train, or from your car to the office we can synchronize our breathing with our steps.
Depending on your pace you could take for instance 3 steps on your in-breath and 4 on your out-breath.
Feel your feet as they touch the ground. Feel your breath. Feel the wind against your face.
If you have enough time and are not in a hurry, walk as if walking is your only goal. Relax and enjoy.

### Biking
When you are riding your bicycle, feel your legs as they move around. Feel your hands on the handlebar. 
Notice the surroundings. Can you appreciate what you see? Notice your feelings as you bike. Are you biking against the wind?
How does that feel?

### Driving your car
When you are driving your car, notice if you are relaxed or impatient. Is there a lot of traffic? Notice how you feel about it.
Can you feel your breath every now and then? Are you in a hurry to get somewhere, of can you enjoy the ride?

### When sitting in the bus or train
When you sit in the bus or train, you could actually meditate. There is nothing you need to do. Just follow your breathing.
In - out, in - out.
Notice the people around you, but at the same time keep following your breath. Feel your belly going up and down with every breath.

### In general
Are you aware of your thoughts? Is your mind very busy or is your mind calm?
Are you aware of your emotions? Can you be with your thoughts, and your emotions without judgement?
Can you notice yourself judging and smile?

#### And always, always be kind to yourself. It is not about being perfect. It is about practicing.
