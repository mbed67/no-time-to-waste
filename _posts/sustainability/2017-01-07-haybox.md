- level: beginner
- time: 5 - 30 minutes (depending on the type of beans)

I usually buy pre cooked beans in jars or cans because that is so convenient. However it also produces quite a lot of waste. And in the case of cans, the lining may contain BPA which can cause health problems. 
Dried beans usually come in plastic bags, but because they are dried, they occupy less space than cooked beans and so relatively little packaging is needed compared to cooked beans. The only problem is that preparing dried beans takes so much effort.
But that actually isn't true. Today I cooked chickpeas and it took me less than 30 minutes.

## What you need

- A coolbox
- A (fleece) blanket
- Optionally: a small pillow
- A small pan with a lid that fits into the coolbox

## Preparation
Raw beans need soaking before they can be cooked. You can soak them overnight in the fridge. They will be twice as large the next morning so add ample water.

## The real work
The next morning, during breakfast, cook the rinsed beans in water without salt (otherwise they won't cook well) for 1/6th of the original cooking time. In the case of chickpeas that would be 25 minutes. Other beans take less time.
After that, put the hot pan with beans and water in the coolbox, wrapped in the blanket. You can cover it up with a small pillow for extra insulation.
Leave it in the box for at least 3 times the original cooking time. That would be 7,5 hours for chickpeas.

That's it! Your beans will be ready when you come home. Bon appetit!
