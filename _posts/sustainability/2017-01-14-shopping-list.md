Buying your groceries once a week will save you a lot of time. But it takes some planning ahead.
Creating a shopping list was never my favourite thing to do, but over time I collected lots of recipes on the web.
I copy their ingredients and store them as snippets on Google drive. With those snippets I can create a shopping list in no time.
And the list will be ordered by category. So all the fruits and vegetables will be together, as well as the Asian ingredients, and so on.
This will make my visit to the supermarket very efficient, and allow me more time to do the things that give me energy.

### But what does this have to do with sustainability?
When you plan your trip to the supermarket and buy groceries for several days, it will be very easy to take your own shopping bags and produce bags with you.
And this way you'll reduce the amount of plastic you consume. And that is sustainable behaviour!
